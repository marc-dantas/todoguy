# TodoGuy
## Docs

## Getting started
TodoGuy has a very simple way of working. You have the to-do list, which contains several items, I have an ID, a Title, and a property of "done" or "not done", shown respectively: `ID: [DONE] TITLE`.

## Actions
TodoGuy has the following actions
- `insert` - Inserts a new to-do in the to-do list.
- `delete` - Deletes a to-do from the to-do list.
- `toggle` - Complete or not complete the to-do.
- `exit` - Exits the application.
